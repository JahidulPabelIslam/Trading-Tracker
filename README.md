# Trading Tracker

While partaking in Forex trading as a small hobby in my spare time, I soon realised that there isn't a nice way to keep track of what trades I had executed. The need to track trades was so that in the future I would know what works and what doesn't.

Therefore I decided to build a quick small online tool to track the history of trades in the Forex market.

#### This will track different information about the trades I enter:

-   Type of trade
-   Reason I entered
-   Result of trade

As well as analysis of trades overall, by week, month, day etc.
