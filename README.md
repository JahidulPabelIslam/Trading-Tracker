In my spare time I was partaking in ForEx trading as a small hobby, and during this time I quickly realised that there isn't a nice way to keep track of what trades I had executed.

The need to track past trades was so that in the future I would know what has worked and what didnâ€™t, and can use this information to improve my performance.

Therefore being a developer I decided put my skills into action and build a small online tool for myself and the team which can be used to track the history of trades in the ForEx market.

#### This will track different information about the trades I enter:

-   Type of trade
-   Reason I entered
-   Result of trade

As well as analysis of trades overall, by week, month, day etc.
