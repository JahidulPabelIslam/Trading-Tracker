[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/570f7ca4dce147628cce7b4d79618c74)](https://www.codacy.com/app/jahidulpabelislam/trading-tracker?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=jahidulpabelislam/trading-tracker&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

While partaking in Forex trading as a small hobby in my spare time, I soon realised that there isn't a nice way to keep track of what trades I had executed. The need to track trades was so that in the future I would know what works and what doesn't.

Therefore I decided to build a quick small online tool to track the history of trades in the Forex market.

#### This will track different information about the trades I enter:

-   Type of trade
-   Reason I entered
-   Result of trade

As well as analysis of trades overall, by week, month, day etc.
